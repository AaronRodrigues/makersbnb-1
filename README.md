## What is it?

It is a website that is similar to (yet legally distinct from) AirBnB.

## How Does it Work?

- Clone this repository
- Navigate to the newly cloned directory via your command line
- ```rackup```
- Visit localhost:[whichever port you racked up to]
- Enjoy pretending to rent strange and whimsical locations for exactly one night

Do not talk about Team Hero
Do not talk about Team Hero
Our stand ups will be at 10am
We enjoy material comforts
We will have debriefs at 5:45, or 6:15 on yoga days
We will check in at 2:00 RE code reviews
We are using Ruby 2.3.1
We commit in the present tense
We use the minimum amount of tools for the job
We look after our wellbeing
We thoroughly review code before we merge
We adhere to Ruby community style guidelines
(Merge) conflicts are inevitable, but itâ€™s all about how you resolve them!
