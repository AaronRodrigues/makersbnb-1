```

## Our Approach

From day one we have tried to make sure that we are communicating well as a team, and this informed our approach to the challenge. We examined the specifications as a group, worked out user stories and then assigned subgroups and a feature to be worked on. We chose to use a Ruby/Sinatra backend and Javascript/JQuery for frontend features as we felt like this was a good balance of technologies that we are familiar with and newer things that we would like to improve at.

## Known Issues/TODOs

- Spaces can be double booked. The implementation of bookings is robust enough that we think adding it would be relatively straightfoward, but we were unable to add the feature before our feature freeze on Friday.
- Users can book their own spaces.
